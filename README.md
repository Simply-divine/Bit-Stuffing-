# Bit-Stuffing-
Implementation of Bit Stuffing in C++ Language.
Firstly, you are required to input the number of elements of 0's and 1's you want in your string for bit stuffing.
Next you enter the elements of 0's and 1's
You will see the program will add a 1 in the string if it encounters continuous five 0's irrespective of the element after five 0's. This is called bit stuffing.
Lastly, you will encounter that the program will also unstuff the string and the original string will be displayed. 

Note: The array is taken of size 100. Please edit it according to your need.
